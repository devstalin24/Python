Descriptive Statistics , provides a summary of your dataset giving a measure of the centre, dispersion and shape of your data. 
Here the data is described as a sample of the whole population, and there are no inferences made from the sample to the whole population, 
unlike Inferential Statistics, in which we model the data on the basis of probability theory.

In this notebook, we will be focussing on three key elements of Descriptive Statistics : 

Measures Of Central Tendency

Mean
Median
Mode 

Measures Of Spread

Range
Outliers
Interquantile Range
Variance 

Dependence

Correlation v/s Causation
